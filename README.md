Challenges -
1. Communication

Distance always matters for group work. As we are from different parts of India, miscommunications were the common challenges for us. But, we make it happen with the help of slack and WhatsApp


As we are using Git collaboration, initially we were facing some technical issues, but continuously co-ordinations, make things easier

These two challenges improve our abilities to be a good Team Player

And we all thank every single team member for contributing and giving there 100% , and completing on time, and making thing simple….
